# Potential Buffer Overflow in Assembly Code

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short assembly code snippet.  The vulnerability arises from adding an offset to a memory location without checking if the resulting address is within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to a program crash, data corruption, or even security exploits.

**Bug:**
The `add eax, 0x10` instruction, without proper bounds checking, could cause a buffer overflow. If the value at `[ebx + 0x10]` already points near the end of the buffer, the addition will go beyond the allocated memory. 

**Solution:**
The solution involves adding a check to ensure that the address remains within the buffer bounds before performing the addition.   The implementation will vary depending on the specifics of the buffer and its size.
